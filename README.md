### A favorite map selector app for StarCraft 2 maps

This project runs locally. Download the files and open up the HTML file `mapSelector.html`. 

##### Why a Map Selector App?
Maps are selected randomly and then presented for players to vote on.

For a 1 v 1 style tournament, it allows StarCraft 2 players to decide on what maps to play on.

A tournament host can enter players votes, select or veto.

Players can only veto 3 times before they are the mercy of the randomized map selection
