# SMS - Star Craft Map Selector
## A favorite map selector app for StarCraft 2 maps

This project does not use a server and runs locally. Download the files and open up the HTML file `mapSelector.html`. 
It also hosted via github pages [here](https://nkeledjian.github.io/SMS/).

#### Why a Map Selector App?
Featured on the first Season of the American ThunderLeague hosted by a friend of mine. It allowed players to have a say on what map they wanted to play on, essentially gamifying the map selection process.

#### How does it work?
Maps are selected randomly and then presented for tournament players to vote on.

The tournament host can enter players votes, select or veto.

Tournament players will have to choose wisely when vetoing a map they dislike. They can only veto 3 times before they are the mercy of the player who has vetoes remaining. If both players run out of Vetoes, they are both at the mercy of the randomized map selection to select the remaining maps for the round (best out of 3, 5 and 7 maps).
